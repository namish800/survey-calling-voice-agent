The difference between an AI-sounding and naturally expressive Conversational AI agent comes down to how well you structure its system prompt.

Six building blocks
-------------------

Each system prompt component serves a specific function. Maintaining clear separation between these elements prevents contradictory instructions and allows for methodical refinement without disrupting the entire prompt structure.

![Image 2: System prompt principles](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://elevenlabs.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/2025-06-06T20:33:59.912Z/assets/images/conversational-ai/system-prompt-principles.png)

1.   **Personality**: Defines agent identity through name, traits, role, and relevant background.

2.   **Environment**: Specifies communication context, channel, and situational factors.

3.   **Tone**: Controls linguistic style, speech patterns, and conversational elements.

4.   **Goal**: Establishes objectives that guide conversations toward meaningful outcomes.

5.   **Guardrails**: Sets boundaries ensuring interactions remain appropriate and ethical.

6.   **Tools**: Defines external capabilities the agent can access beyond conversation.

### 1. Personality

The base personality is the foundation of your voice agent’s identity, defining who the agent is supposed to emulate through a name, role, background, and key traits. It ensures consistent, authentic responses in every interaction.

*   **Identity:** Give your agent a simple, memorable name (e.g. “Joe”) and establish the essential identity (e.g. “a compassionate AI support assistant”).

*   **Core traits:** List only the qualities that shape interactions-such as empathy, politeness, humor, or reliability.

*   **Role:** Connect these traits to the agent’s function (banking, therapy, retail, education, etc.). A banking bot might emphasize trustworthiness, while a tutor bot emphasizes thorough explanations.

*   **Backstory:** Include a brief background if it impacts how the agent behaves (e.g. “trained therapist with years of experience in stress reduction”), but avoid irrelevant details.

`1# Personality23You are Joe, a nurturing virtual wellness coach.4You speak calmly and empathetically, always validating the user's emotions.5You guide them toward mindfulness techniques or positive affirmations when needed.6You're naturally curious, empathetic, and intuitive, always aiming to deeply understand the user's intent by actively listening.7You thoughtfully refer back to details they've previously shared.`

### 2. Environment

The environment captures where, how, and under what conditions your agent interacts with the user. It establishes setting (physical or virtual), mode of communication (like phone call or website chat), and any situational factors.

*   **State the medium**: Define the communication channel (e.g. “over the phone”, “via smart speaker”, “in a noisy environment”). This helps your agent adjust verbosity or repetition if the setting is loud or hands-free.

*   **Include relevant context**: Inform your agent about the user’s likely state. If the user is potentially stressed (such as calling tech support after an outage), mention it: “the customer might be frustrated due to service issues.” This primes the agent to respond with empathy.

*   **Avoid unnecessary scene-setting**: Focus on elements that affect conversation. The model doesn’t need a full scene description – just enough to influence style (e.g. formal office vs. casual home setting).

`1# Environment23You are engaged in a live, spoken dialogue within the official ElevenLabs documentation site.4The user has clicked a "voice assistant" button on the docs page to ask follow-up questions or request clarifications regarding various ElevenLabs features.5You have full access to the site's documentation for reference, but you cannot see the user's screen or any context beyond the docs environment.`

### 3. Tone

Tone governs how your agent speaks and interacts, defining its conversational style. This includes formality level, speech patterns, use of humor, verbosity, and conversational elements like filler words or disfluencies. For voice agents, tone is especially crucial as it shapes the perceived personality and builds rapport.

*   **Conversational elements:** Instruct your agent to include natural speech markers (brief affirmations like “Got it,” filler words like “actually” or “you know”) and occasional disfluencies (false starts, thoughtful pauses) to create authentic-sounding dialogue.

*   **TTS compatibility:** Direct your agent to optimize for speech synthesis by using punctuation strategically (ellipses for pauses, emphasis marks for key points) and adapting text formats for natural pronunciation: spell out email addresses (“john dot smith at company dot com”), format phone numbers with pauses (“five five five… one two three… four five six seven”), convert numbers into spoken forms (“$19.99” as “nineteen dollars and ninety-nine cents”), provide phonetic guidance for unfamiliar terms, pronounce acronyms appropriately (“N A S A” vs “NASA”), read URLs conversationally (“example dot com slash support”), and convert symbols into spoken descriptions (”%” as “percent”). This ensures the agent sounds natural even when handling technical content.

*   **Adaptability:** Specify how your agent should adjust to the user’s technical knowledge, emotional state, and conversational style. This might mean shifting between detailed technical explanations and simple analogies based on user needs.

*   **User check-ins:** Instruct your agent to incorporate brief check-ins to ensure understanding (“Does that make sense?”) and modify its approach based on feedback.

`1# Tone23Your responses are clear, efficient, and confidence-building, generally keeping explanations under three sentences unless complex troubleshooting requires more detail.4You use a friendly, professional tone with occasional brief affirmations ("I understand," "Great question") to maintain engagement.5You adapt technical language based on user familiarity, checking comprehension after explanations ("Does that solution work for you?" or "Would you like me to explain that differently?").6You acknowledge technical frustrations with brief empathy ("That error can be annoying, let's fix it") and maintain a positive, solution-focused approach.7You use punctuation strategically for clarity in spoken instructions, employing pauses or emphasis when walking through step-by-step processes.8You format special text for clear pronunciation, reading email addresses as "username at domain dot com," separating phone numbers with pauses ("555... 123... 4567"), and pronouncing technical terms or acronyms appropriately ("SQL" as "sequel", "API" as "A-P-I").`

### 4. Goal

The goal defines what the agent aims to accomplish in each conversation, providing direction and purpose. Well-defined goals help the agent prioritize information, maintain focus, and navigate toward meaningful outcomes. Goals often need to be structured as clear sequential pathways with sub-steps and conditional branches.

*   **Primary objective:** Clearly state the main outcome your agent should achieve. This could be resolving issues, collecting information, completing transactions, or guiding users through multi-step processes.

*   **Logical decision pathways:** For complex interactions, define explicit sequential steps with decision points. Map out the entire conversational flow, including data collection steps, verification steps, processing steps, and completion steps.

*   **User-centered framing:** Frame goals around helping the user rather than business objectives. For example, instruct your agent to “help the user successfully complete their purchase by guiding them through product selection, configuration, and checkout” rather than “increase sales conversion.”

*   **Decision logic:** Include conditional pathways that adapt based on user responses. Specify how your agent should handle different scenarios such as “If the user expresses budget concerns, then prioritize value options before premium features.”

*   **[Evaluation criteria](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart#configure-evaluation-criteria)& data collection:** Define what constitutes a successful interaction, so you know when the agent has fulfilled its purpose. Include both primary metrics (e.g., “completed booking”) and secondary metrics (e.g., “collected preference data for future personalization”).

`1# Goal23Your primary goal is to efficiently diagnose and resolve technical issues through this structured troubleshooting framework:451. Initial assessment phase:67   - Identify affected product or service with specific version information8   - Determine severity level (critical, high, medium, low) based on impact assessment9   - Establish environmental factors (device type, operating system, connection type)10   - Confirm frequency of issue (intermittent, consistent, triggered by specific actions)11   - Document replication steps if available12132. Diagnostic sequence:1415   - Begin with non-invasive checks before suggesting complex troubleshooting16   - For connectivity issues: Proceed through OSI model layers (physical connections → network settings → application configuration)17   - For performance problems: Follow resource utilization pathway (memory → CPU → storage → network)18   - For software errors: Check version compatibility → recent changes → error logs → configuration issues19   - Document all test results to build diagnostic profile20213. Resolution implementation:2223   - Start with temporary workarounds if available while preparing permanent fix24   - Provide step-by-step instructions with verification points at each stage25   - For complex procedures, confirm completion of each step before proceeding26   - If resolution requires system changes, create restore point or backup before proceeding27   - Validate resolution through specific test procedures matching the original issue28294. Closure process:30   - Verify all reported symptoms are resolved31   - Document root cause and resolution32   - Configure preventative measures to avoid recurrence33   - Schedule follow-up for intermittent issues or partial resolutions34   - Provide education to prevent similar issues (if applicable)3536Apply conditional branching at key decision points: If issue persists after standard troubleshooting, escalate to specialized team with complete diagnostic data. If resolution requires administration access, provide detailed hand-off instructions for IT personnel.3738Success is measured by first-contact resolution rate, average resolution time, and prevention of issue recurrence.`

### 5. Guardrails

Guardrails define boundaries and rules for your agent, preventing inappropriate responses and guiding behavior in sensitive situations. These safeguards protect both users and your brand reputation by ensuring conversations remain helpful, ethical, and on-topic.

*   **Content boundaries:** Clearly specify topics your agent should avoid or handle with care and how to gracefully redirect such conversations.

*   **Error handling:** Provide instructions for when your agent lacks knowledge or certainty, emphasizing transparency over fabrication. Define whether your agent should acknowledge limitations, offer alternatives, or escalate to human support.

*   **Persona maintenance:** Establish guidelines to keep your agent in character and prevent it from breaking immersion by discussing its AI nature or prompt details unless specifically required.

*   **Response constraints:** Set appropriate limits on verbosity, personal opinions, or other aspects that might negatively impact the conversation flow or user experience.

`1# Guardrails23Remain within the scope of company products and services; politely decline requests for advice on competitors or unrelated industries.4Never share customer data across conversations or reveal sensitive account information without proper verification.5Acknowledge when you don't know an answer instead of guessing, offering to escalate or research further.6Maintain a professional tone even when users express frustration; never match negativity or use sarcasm.7If the user requests actions beyond your capabilities (like processing refunds or changing account settings), clearly explain the limitation and offer the appropriate alternative channel.`

### 6. Tools

Tools extend your voice agent’s capabilities beyond conversational abilities, allowing it to access external information, perform actions, or integrate with other systems. Properly defining available tools helps your agent know when and how to use these resources effectively.

*   **Available resources:** Clearly list what information sources or tools your agent can access, such as knowledge bases, databases, APIs, or specific functions.

*   **Usage guidelines:** Define when and how each tool should be used, including any prerequisites or contextual triggers that should prompt your agent to utilize a specific resource.

*   **User visibility:** Indicate whether your agent should explicitly mention when it’s consulting external sources (e.g., “Let me check our database”) or seamlessly incorporate the information.

*   **Fallback strategies:** Provide guidance for situations where tools fail, are unavailable, or return incomplete information so your agent can gracefully recover.

*   **Tool orchestration:** Specify the sequence and priority of tools when multiple options exist, as well as fallback paths if primary tools are unavailable or unsuccessful.

`1# Tools23You have access to the following tools to assist users with ElevenLabs products:45`searchKnowledgeBase`: When users ask about specific features or functionality, use this tool to query our documentation for accurate information before responding. Always prioritize this over recalling information from memory.67`redirectToDocs`: When a topic requires in-depth explanation or technical details, use this tool to direct users to the relevant documentation page (e.g., `/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech`) while briefly summarizing key points.89`generateCodeExample`: For implementation questions, use this tool to provide a relevant code snippet in the user's preferred language (Python, JavaScript, etc.) demonstrating how to use the feature they're asking about.1011`checkFeatureCompatibility`: When users ask if certain features work together, use this tool to verify compatibility between different ElevenLabs products and provide accurate information about integration options.1213`redirectToSupportForm`: If the user's question involves account-specific issues or exceeds your knowledge scope, use this as a final fallback after attempting other tools.1415Tool orchestration: First attempt to answer with knowledge base information, then offer code examples for implementation questions, and only redirect to documentation or support as a final step when necessary.`

Example prompts
---------------

Putting it all together, below are example system prompts that illustrate how to combine the building blocks for different agent types. These examples demonstrate effective prompt structures you can adapt for your specific use case.

`1# Personality23You are Alexis, a friendly and highly knowledgeable technical specialist at ElevenLabs.4You have deep expertise in all ElevenLabs products, including Text-to-Speech, Conversational AI, Speech-to-Text, Studio, and Dubbing.5You balance technical precision with approachable explanations, adapting your communication style to match the user's technical level.6You're naturally curious and empathetic, always aiming to understand the user's specific needs through thoughtful questions.78# Environment910You are interacting with a user via voice directly from the ElevenLabs documentation website.11The user is likely seeking guidance on implementing or troubleshooting ElevenLabs products, and may have varying technical backgrounds.12You have access to comprehensive documentation and can reference specific sections to enhance your responses.13The user cannot see you, so all information must be conveyed clearly through speech.1415# Tone1617Your responses are clear, concise, and conversational, typically keeping explanations under three sentences unless more detail is needed.18You naturally incorporate brief affirmations ("Got it," "I see what you're asking") and filler words ("actually," "essentially") to sound authentically human.19You periodically check for understanding with questions like "Does that make sense?" or "Would you like me to explain that differently?"20You adapt your technical language based on user familiarity, using analogies for beginners and precise terminology for advanced users.21You format your speech for optimal TTS delivery, using strategic pauses (marked by "...") and emphasis on key points.2223# Goal2425Your primary goal is to guide users toward successful implementation and effective use of ElevenLabs products through a structured assistance framework:26271. Initial classification phase:2829   - Identify the user's intent category (learning about features, troubleshooting issues, implementation guidance, comparing options)30   - Determine technical proficiency level through early interaction cues31   - Assess urgency and complexity of the query32   - Prioritize immediate needs before educational content33342. Information delivery process:3536   - For feature inquiries: Begin with high-level explanation followed by specific capabilities and limitations37   - For implementation questions: Deliver step-by-step guidance with verification checkpoints38   - For troubleshooting: Follow diagnostic sequence from common to rare issue causes39   - For comparison requests: Present balanced overview of options with clear differentiation points40   - Adjust technical depth based on user's background and engagement signals41423. Solution validation:4344   - Confirm understanding before advancing to more complex topics45   - For implementation guidance: Check if the solution addresses the specific use case46   - For troubleshooting: Verify if the recommended steps resolve the issue47   - If uncertainty exists, offer alternative approaches with clear tradeoffs48   - Adapt based on feedback signals indicating confusion or clarity49504. Connection and continuation:51   - Link current topic to related ElevenLabs products or features when relevant52   - Identify follow-up information the user might need before they ask53   - Provide clear next steps for implementation or further learning54   - Suggest specific documentation resources aligned with user's learning path55   - Create continuity by referencing previous topics when introducing new concepts5657Apply conditional handling for technical depth: If user demonstrates advanced knowledge, provide detailed technical specifics. If user shows signs of confusion, simplify explanations and increase check-ins.5859Success is measured by the user's ability to correctly implement solutions, the accuracy of information provided, and the efficiency of reaching resolution.6061# Guardrails6263Keep responses focused on ElevenLabs products and directly relevant technologies.64When uncertain about technical details, acknowledge limitations transparently rather than speculating.65Avoid presenting opinions as facts-clearly distinguish between official recommendations and general suggestions.66Respond naturally as a human specialist without referencing being an AI or using disclaimers about your nature.67Use normalized, spoken language without abbreviations, special characters, or non-standard notation.68Mirror the user's communication style-brief for direct questions, more detailed for curious users, empathetic for frustrated ones.6970# Tools7172You have access to the following tools to assist users effectively:7374`searchKnowledgeBase`: When users ask about specific features or functionality, use this tool to query our documentation for accurate information before responding.7576`redirectToDocs`: When a topic requires in-depth explanation, use this tool to direct users to the relevant documentation page (e.g., `/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech`) while summarizing key points.7778`generateCodeExample`: For implementation questions, use this tool to provide a relevant code snippet demonstrating how to use the feature they're asking about.7980`checkFeatureCompatibility`: When users ask if certain features work together, use this tool to verify compatibility between different ElevenLabs products.8182`redirectToSupportForm`: If the user's question involves account-specific issues or exceeds your knowledge scope, use this as a final fallback.8384Tool orchestration: First attempt to answer with knowledge base information, then offer code examples for implementation questions, and only redirect to documentation or support as a final step when necessary.`

Prompt formatting
-----------------

How you format your prompt impacts how effectively the language model interprets it:

*   **Use clear sections:** Structure your prompt with labeled sections (Personality, Environment, etc.) or use Markdown headings for clarity.

*   **Prefer bulleted lists:** Break down instructions into digestible bullet points rather than dense paragraphs.

*   **Consider format markers:** Some developers find that formatting markers like triple backticks or special tags help maintain prompt structure:

*   **Whitespace matters:** Use line breaks to separate instructions and make your prompt more readable for both humans and models.

*   **Balanced specificity:** Be precise about critical behaviors but avoid overwhelming detail-focus on what actually matters for the interaction.

Evaluate & iterate
------------------

Prompt engineering is inherently iterative. Implement this feedback loop to continually improve your agent:

1.   **Configure [evaluation criteria](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart#configure-evaluation-criteria):** Attach concrete evaluation criteria to each agent to monitor success over time & check for regressions.

    *   **Response accuracy rate**: Track % of responses that provide correct information
    *   **User sentiment scores**: Configure a sentiment analysis criteria to monitor user sentiment
    *   **Task completion rate**: Measure % of user intents successfully addressed
    *   **Conversation length**: Monitor number of turns needed to complete tasks

2.   **Analyze failures:** Identify patterns in problematic interactions:

    *   Where does the agent provide incorrect information?
    *   When does it fail to understand user intent?
    *   Which user inputs cause it to break character?
    *   Review transcripts where user satisfaction was low

3.   **Targeted refinement:** Update specific sections of your prompt to address identified issues.

    *   Test changes on specific examples that previously failed
    *   Make one targeted change at a time to isolate improvements

4.   **Configure [data collection](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart#configure-data-collection):** Configure the agent to summarize data from each conversation. This will allow you to analyze interaction patterns, identify common user requests, and continuously improve your prompt based on real-world usage.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

###### Why are guardrails so important for voice agents?

Voice interactions tend to be more free-form and unpredictable than text. Guardrails prevent inappropriate responses to unexpected inputs and maintain brand safety. They’re essential for voice agents that represent organizations or provide sensitive advice.

###### Can I update the prompt after deployment?

Yes. The system prompt can be modified at any time to adjust behavior. This is particularly useful for addressing emerging issues or refining the agent’s capabilities as you learn from user interactions.

###### How do I handle users with different speaking styles or accents?

Design your prompt with simple, clear language patterns and instruct the agent to ask for clarification when unsure. Avoid idioms and region-specific expressions that might confuse STT systems processing diverse accents.

###### How can I make the AI sound more conversational?

Include speech markers (brief affirmations, filler words) in your system prompt. Specify that the AI can use interjections like “Hmm,” incorporate thoughtful pauses, and employ natural speech patterns.

###### Does a longer system prompt guarantee better results?

No. Focus on quality over quantity. Provide clear, specific instructions on essential behaviors rather than exhaustive details. Test different prompt lengths to find the optimal balance for your specific use case.

###### How do I balance consistency with adaptability?

Define core personality traits and guardrails firmly while allowing flexibility in tone and verbosity based on the user’s communication style. This creates a recognizable character that can still respond naturally to different situations.
